### Contains Duplicate III

Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

#### Example 1:

```Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3, t = 0
Output: true
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 2
Output: true
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], k = 2, t = 3
Output: false
``` 

#### Constraints:

* 0 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
* -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
* 0 <= k <= 104
* 0 <= t <= 231 - 1
