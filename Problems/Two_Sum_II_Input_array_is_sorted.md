### Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

#### Example:

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

#### Note:

* Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
* You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
