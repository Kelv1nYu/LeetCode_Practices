### Single Number 

**Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.**

#### Example 1:

```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

#### Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
