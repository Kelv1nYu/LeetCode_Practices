### Reverse Words in a String

**Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.**

#### Example 1:

```
Input: "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```
#### Example 2:

```
Input: "  hello world!  "
Output: "world! hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

#### Note:

* A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
* Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
* You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

#### Follow up:

For C programmers, try to solve it in-place in O(1) extra space.
