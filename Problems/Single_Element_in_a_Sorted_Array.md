### Single Element in a Sorted Array

You are given a **sorted array** consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. **Find this single element that appears only once.**

#### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
``` 

#### Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
* 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

#### Follow up:

Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

### Single Number 

**Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.**

#### Example 1:

```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

#### Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
