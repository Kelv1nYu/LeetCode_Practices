### Implement strStr()

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```

#### Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? 

This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string.

This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

#### Constraints:

haystack and needle consist only of lowercase English characters.
