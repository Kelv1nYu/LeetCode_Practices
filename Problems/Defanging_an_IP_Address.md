### Defanging an IP Address

Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

 

### Example 1:

<pre>
Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"
</pre>

### Example 2:

<pre>
Input: address = "255.100.50.0"
Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"
</pre>
 
### Constraints:

The given address is a valid IPv4 address.
