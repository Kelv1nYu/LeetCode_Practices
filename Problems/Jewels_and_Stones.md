## Jewels and Stones

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

### example1
<pre>
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
</pre>

### example2
<pre>
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
</pre>

### note
1. S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
2. The characters in J are distinct.
