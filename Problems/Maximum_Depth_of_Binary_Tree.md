### Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

**Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.**

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

#### Example:

```
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its depth = 3.
```

#### Note:

A leaf is a node with no children.
