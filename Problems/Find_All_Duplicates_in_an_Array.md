### Find All Duplicates in an Array

Given an integer array nums of length n where all the integers of nums are in the range [1, n] and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [2,3]
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: [1]
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: []
``` 

#### Constraints:

* n == nums.length
* 1 <= n <= 105
* 1 <= nums[i] <= n
* Each element in nums appears once or twice.
 
#### Follow up:

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?
