### Pascal's Triangle II

**Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.**

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

#### Example:

```
Input: 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
```

#### Follow up:

Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?

#### Note:

Row index starts from 0.
