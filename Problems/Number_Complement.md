### Number Complement

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

#### Note:

The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

#### Example 1:
<pre>
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
</pre>

#### Example 2:
<pre>
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
</pre>
