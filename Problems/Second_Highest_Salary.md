### Second Highest Salary

**Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the `Employee` table.**

```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above `Employee` table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

```
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```
