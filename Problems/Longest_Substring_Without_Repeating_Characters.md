### Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

**Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.**

#### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

#### Example 4:

```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
``` 

#### Constraints:

* 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
* s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
